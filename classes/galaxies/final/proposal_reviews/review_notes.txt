Notes from galaxies proposal reviews.

Introduction should be short. Transition to what you are testing by paragraph 2.

Focused scientific question. Repeat several times in different formats.

Summary is last paragraph reviewers read! Should be the paragraph you want the
reviewers to write.

Admit weaknesses. Discuss how to overcome them. Be honest and upfront. Shows
you have thought deeply about project.

Figures which show the analysis the author will be using give confidence to the
reader that the proposal is feasible.

Determine hard numbers for sample.

Don't dilute your best idea with your second best idea.

TAC will grade weeks before. At review, TAC members will reread notes and
abstract. So make abstract great.
