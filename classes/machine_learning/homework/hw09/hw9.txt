In the R/conf.int directory you will find 5a.R, 
an R code which  
generates noisy data at 100 points on [0,1]  from
a given curve with specified noise standard deviation
(ss), replicates this  10 times,
generates a cubic spline curve fit with the gcv estimate
of lambda, generates the "bayesian confidence intervals", 
generates
a table result.txt with the smoothing parameter, the
gcvscore, the ratio of the estimated
to the true standard deviation, counts the
number of "true" data points inside the
confidence interval, and averages the
counts.

Try the code with the given true curve, n = 100 and 
sigma = 1. Then define two more curves, one a 
"smooth" curve, and one with a break or spike like 
feature, and experiment with the code with several 
different sample sizes and sigma's to see if you 
identify over what range of sample sizes, and sigmas the 
results are reasonable. Summarize your results with 
a few plots and tables.

Please pick your own seed(s).
