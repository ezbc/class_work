Please consider the following challenge problem.  Write up a short description (1-2 pages at most) of your ideas for solving it.


Design an algorithm to find the genes that are most predictive of a disease or phenotype

	DNA microarrays can be used to measure the amount of protein produced by
	each gene (the so-called "gene expression level").  

	Suppose we measure the gene expression levels of a number of people with and without 
	a particular disease.  Assume m genes are measured.

	What is your data matrix A?

        - k x m matrix, k people, m genes

	How would you decide which genes are most important to or involved in
	the disease process?

	    - Ax = L where L is our label matrix
          p1 = (0.5*g1 + 0.1*g2) = well
          p2 = (2*g1 + 0.4*g2) = sick

          (0.5 0.1  (g1 = (1
           2   0.4)  g2) = 0)

    Now suppose we have gene expression data for n different strains of yeast.
    We also measure phenotypic similarities between the different strains
    (e.g., similarity measures based on the observable characteristics or
    traits of the strains like shaper or color).

    In other words, we have an n x n matrix of similarity values, say ranging
    continuously between 0 (disimilar) to 1 (identical).

    How would you determine which genes are most important for predicting
    phenotypic similarities?
